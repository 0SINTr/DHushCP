- **Automated Cleanup:** Automatically handles session termination and cleans up sensitive data upon completion.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive prompts guide users through message input and confirmation steps.
- **Checksum Verification:** Implements SHA-256 checksums to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

## üìà Advantages

- **Stealthy Communication:** Leverages common network protocols (DHCP) to facilitate hidden message exchanges, reducing the likelihood of detection.
- **No Additional Infrastructure:** Operates over existing network setups without the need for specialized hardware or software.
- **Flexible Integration:** Easily integrates into various network environments, making it adaptable for different use cases.
- **User Control:** Empowers users with interactive prompts, ensuring that communication is deliberate and controlled.
- **Robust Security:** Combines multiple security mechanisms to safeguard data against interception and unauthorized access.

## üîÑ Communication Flow

1. **Initial Exchange:**
   - **Client:**
     - Generates a unique session ID.
     - Detects and selects the active wireless interface.
     - Releases any existing IP address on the interface.
     - Generates RSA key pair (public/private keys).
     - Sends a DHCP Discover packet embedding its public key, a DHushCP-ID (option 224), and the session ID (option 225).
   
   - **Server:**
     - Receives the DHCP Discover packet.
     - Extracts and reassembles the client's public key.
     - Generates its own RSA key pair.
     - Sends a DHCP Offer packet embedding its public key, DHushCP-ID, and the same session ID.

2. **Message Transmission:**
   - **Client:**
     - Receives the DHCP Offer.
     - Prompts the user to input a message.
     - Encrypts the message using the server's public key.
     - Fragments the encrypted message and embeds it across DHCP options.
     - Sends a DHCP Request packet with the encrypted message and session ID.
   
   - **Server:**
     - Receives the DHCP Request.
     - Reassembles and decrypts the client's message using its private key.
     - Displays the message to the server user.
     - Prompts the server user to press Enter to confirm reading the message.
     - Prompts the server user to input a reply.
     - Encrypts the reply using the client's public key.
     - Fragments the encrypted reply and embeds it across DHCP options.
     - Sends a DHCP Ack packet with the encrypted reply and session ID.

3. **Finalization:**
   - **Client:**
     - Receives the DHCP Ack.
     - Reassembles and decrypts the server's reply using its private key.
     - Displays the message to the user.
     - Waits for the user to press Enter to confirm reading the message.
     - Sends a DHCP Release packet and performs cleanup.
   
   - **Server:**
     - Receives the DHCP Release packet.
     - Automatically performs cleanup, removing sensitive data and terminating the session.

## üïµÔ∏è **Example Use Case for DHushCP**

#### **Scenario: Covert Communication in a Public Space**

Imagine a scenario where two individuals (Alice and Bob) need to communicate covertly while being in a public space, such as a coffee shop. They both arrive separately and sit at different tables, appearing to be independent customers. They do not connect to the public Wi-Fi network, but their laptops are within wireless range of each other.

#### **Problem**
Alice and Bob need to exchange a short message without creating any obvious network link or visible ad-hoc connection that could attract attention. Using traditional messaging apps or establishing a direct Wi-Fi connection could be easily detected by anyone monitoring the network.

#### **Solution: Using DHushCP for Covert Communication**

1. **Step 1: Bob Starts the DHushCP Server**
   - Bob runs the DHushCP server on his laptop.
   - His server listens for DHCP Discover packets that contain a special identifier (custom DHCP option 224) set by DHushCP.
   - This ensures that his server only responds to legitimate DHushCP client packets and ignores other DHCP traffic.

2. **Step 2: Alice Starts the DHushCP Client**
   - Alice runs the DHushCP client on her laptop.
   - Her client sends a DHCP Discover packet that contains her public RSA key, embedded and fragmented into multiple DHCP options, along with the DHushCP-ID (option 224) and a unique session ID (option 225).
   - This packet is **broadcast** in the local wireless network range.

3. **Step 3: Server Responds to Client's DHCP Discover**
   - Upon receiving Alice's DHCP Discover packet, Bob‚Äôs server verifies the DHushCP-ID and session ID.
   - The server then sends back a DHCP Offer packet containing its own public RSA key, embedded and fragmented across multiple DHCP options, along with the same session ID.

4. **Step 4: Key Exchange and Secure Message Transmission**
   - Once Alice receives the DHCP Offer from Bob, both have securely exchanged public keys.
   - Alice inputs a short covert message (e.g., **"Meet at the corner at 2 PM"**) and her client encrypts the message using Bob‚Äôs public key.
   - The encrypted message is fragmented into multiple DHCP options and sent to Bob in a DHCP Request packet.

5. **Step 5: Server Receives and Decrypts the Message**
   - Bob‚Äôs server receives the DHCP Request, reassembles the fragments, and decrypts the message using his private RSA key.
   - The decrypted message is displayed on his terminal.
   - Bob then inputs a covert response (e.g., **"Understood. See you there."**) and encrypts it using Alice‚Äôs public key.
   - The encrypted reply is fragmented into multiple DHCP options and sent to Alice in a DHCP Ack packet.

6. **Step 6: Client Receives and Decrypts the Reply**
   - Alice‚Äôs client receives the DHCP Ack, reassembles the fragments, and decrypts the reply using her private RSA key.
   - The decrypted reply message is displayed to her.
   - Both Alice and Bob perform cleanup by deleting the exchanged RSA keys and clearing any sensitive logs or data from their terminals.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **One-Time Message Exchange Design**
- **DHushCP is designed for short-form, one-time message exchanges**. It supports a single message from the client to the server, followed by a response from the server back to the client.
- After each message exchange, the session is terminated, and the RSA keys are securely deleted. If further communication is needed, the process should be restarted from scratch, with **new RSA key pairs** being generated.
- This approach maximizes security by ensuring that each communication session is unique and does not reuse any cryptographic keys.

#### **Why This Setup Is Effective**
- The entire exchange happens within **standard DHCP packets**, blending into regular network traffic.
- There is **no visible Wi-Fi connection** or direct link between Alice and Bob.
- After the communication ends, both laptops securely delete the exchanged RSA keys and clear the terminal, leaving no traces behind.
- This approach is useful in scenarios where Alice and Bob want to avoid suspicion and keep their presence discreet while exchanging critical information.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora)
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies:**
  - `scapy` for packet crafting and sniffing
  - `cryptography` for RSA encryption and checksum generation
- **Privileges:** Root or sudo access to send and receive DHCP packets
- **Network Interface:** Active wireless interface in UP state

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DHushCP.git
   cd DHushCP
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy cryptography
   ```

3. **Grant Necessary Permissions:** Both client and server scripts require root privileges to send and sniff DHCP packets. You can run the scripts using `sudo`:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 client.py
   sudo python3 server.py
   ```

4. **Configure Wireless Interface:**

Ensure that your wireless interface is active and in the UP state.
The scripts will automatically detect and prompt you to select the active interface if multiple are detected.

5. **Run the Scripts:**

**Server:**
`sudo python3 server.py`

**Client:**
`sudo python3 client.py`

Follow the on-screen prompts to initiate and manage the communication session.

## üìö Usage

1. **Start the Server:**

- Run the server script on the intended host.
- The server will listen for DHCP Discover packets from the client.
- Upon receiving a DHCP Discover, the server will send a DHCP Offer embedding its public key and session ID.

2. **Initiate Communication from the Client:**

- Run the client script on the client's machine.
- The client sends a DHCP Discover embedding its public key and session ID.
- Upon receiving the DHCP Offer from the server, the client prompts the user to input a message, encrypts it using the server's public key, and sends a DHCP Request.

3. **Server Responds:**

- The server decrypts the client's message, displays it to the server user, and prompts the user to input a reply.
- The server encrypts the reply using the client's public key and sends a DHCP Ack.

4. **Finalize the Session:**

- The client decrypts the server's reply, displays it to the user, and upon user confirmation, sends a DHCP Release.
- The server detects the Release and performs cleanup automatically, terminating the session.

### üßÆ **Available Message Space Calculation**

- **Total Usable Space Across 4 DHCP Options:** 1,004 bytes
- **RSA Encryption Overhead (4 blocks):** 1,024 bytes
- **Plaintext Capacity (4 blocks √ó 190 bytes):** 760 bytes
- **Checksum Size:** 32 bytes
- **Available Message Space:** 760 bytes - 32 bytes = **728 bytes**

As a result, the current limit for messages is **500 characters**.
