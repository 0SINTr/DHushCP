# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **DHushCP: Covert Communication Using DHCP**

## üìù **Summary**
**DHushCP** is a covert communication tool that uses the DHCP protocol to enable secure and hidden message exchange between two machines. **DHushCP** utilizes principles of **network steganography** by embedding encrypted messages within protocol fields that are not commonly inspected. Network steganography involves hiding data in plain sight by using legitimate network protocols.

By embedding encrypted messages into DHCP option fields, **DHushCP** establishes a secure communication channel that blends seamlessly into regular network traffic, making it extremely difficult to detect. This tool is ideal for scenarios where privacy and stealth are paramount, such as discreet communications in public places or controlled environments.

With features like RSA public-key encryption, message fragmentation, custom DHCP options for server validation, and automatic cleanup, **DHushCP** ensures that communication is not only secure but also leaves no traces behind once the session is completed.

## üîí **Why Use DHushCP?**
In environments where privacy and security are crucial, traditional messaging applications and network connections can leave traces or be detected easily. **DHushCP** provides a unique solution by using a widely accepted network management protocol (DHCP) for message exchange. It turns a standard protocol into a covert communication channel without creating persistent connections or visible network links, making it an ideal tool for:

- **Stealth Communication in Public Spaces:** Communicate discreetly without establishing visible connections.
- **Red Team Operations:** Test the robustness of network monitoring tools and identify detection gaps.
- **Privacy and Security Research:** Explore covert communication methods in secure environments.

### üîë **Key Security and Privacy Features**
1. **Ephemeral Network Traffic:**
   - **DHushCP** leverages broadcast-based DHCP packets to exchange messages, leaving no visible network connections and blending into normal network noise.

2. **Stealthy Communication Using Standard Protocols:**
   - By using DHCP, which is essential for network operation, **DHushCP** avoids detection by intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls that are configured to monitor more active communication protocols.

3. **RSA Public-Key Encryption:**
   - **DHushCP** exchanges RSA public keys during the initial handshake and encrypts messages using the recipient‚Äôs public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the content.

4. **Fragmented Message Embedding:**
   - Encrypted messages are split into smaller fragments and embedded across multiple DHCP option fields (`43`, `60`, `77`, and `125`), making it difficult to reconstruct the entire message.

5. **Custom DHCP Option for Server Validation:**
   - To prevent interference from other DHCP servers in the vicinity, **DHushCP** uses a **custom DHCP option** (`224`) that serves as a unique identifier. This ensures that the client only accepts offers from the intended **DHushCP** server and ignores any other DHCP Offers that might be present.

6. **Automatic Secure Cleanup:**
   - After communication ends, **DHushCP** deletes the RSA keys from memory, clears the terminal screen, and exits, leaving no traces on the devices.

## üîß **How DHushCP Works**
### üóÇÔ∏è **Step-by-Step Communication Process**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Public Key Exchange**
- **Client:**
  - Generates a fresh RSA public-private key pair.
  - Sends a `DHCP Discover` packet containing its public key, split across multiple DHCP options, along with a **custom DHCP option** (`224`) to uniquely identify the **DHushCP** session.

- **Server:**
  - Receives the `DHCP Discover` packet, validates the **custom DHCP option** (`224`), and reassembles the client‚Äôs public key.
  - Generates its own RSA key pair.
  - Sends a `DHCP Offer` packet containing its own public key, split across DHCP options, and includes the **custom DHCP option** (`224`).

- **Client:**
  - Receives and reassembles the server‚Äôs public key from the fragmented options in the `DHCP Offer` packet.
  - Validates the **custom DHCP option** to ensure that the `DHCP Offer` is from the intended **DHushCP** server.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Message Input and Encryption**
- **Client:**
  - Prompts the user for a message to send to the server.
  - Encrypts the message using the **server‚Äôs public key**.
  - Validates the encrypted message size to ensure it can fit into the available DHCP options.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fragmented Message Transmission**
- **Client:**
  - Splits the encrypted message into smaller fragments and embeds them into the DHCP options.
  - Sends a `DHCP Request` packet containing these message fragments.

- **Server:**
  - Receives and reassembles the encrypted message from the DHCP options.
  - Decrypts the message using its **private key**.
  - Prompts the user for a response message to send back.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Message Reception and Decryption**
- **Server:**
  - Splits its encrypted response into fragments and sends them in a `DHCP Ack` packet.

- **Client:**
  - Receives and reassembles the response.
  - Decrypts the message using its **private key** and displays it.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Secure Cleanup**
- **Client:**
  - Sends a `DHCP Release` packet to formally indicate the end of the communication.
  - Deletes its own RSA private key and the server‚Äôs public key from memory.
  - Clears the terminal screen and prints a confirmation dot (`.`).

- **Server:**
  - Receives the `DHCP Release` packet from the client.
  - Deletes its own RSA private key and the client‚Äôs public key from memory.
  - Clears the terminal screen and prints a confirmation dot (`.`).

## üìè **Calculating Maximum Message Length**

DHushCP uses multiple DHCP option fields to embed encrypted messages. To estimate the maximum plaintext message size that can be securely transmitted, we need to consider the available space in these DHCP options and the RSA encryption overhead.

### üßÆ **Step-by-Step Calculation**

1. **Total Available Space Per DHCP Option Field**
   - Each DHCP option field has a **maximum capacity of 255 bytes**.
   - However, a portion of each field is used for metadata:
     - **Option Number**: 1 byte
     - **Length Field**: 1 byte
     - **Fragmentation Metadata**: 2 bytes (1 byte for sequence number, 1 byte for total fragments)

   - **Usable space per DHCP option field**:
     ```
     255 bytes - 4 bytes = 251 bytes
     ```

2. **Total Space Across All Used DHCP Option Fields**
   - DHushCP utilizes **four different DHCP option fields** (`43`, `60`, `77`, and `125`).
   
   - **Total usable space across 4 options**:
     ```
     251 bytes/option √ó 4 options = 1004 bytes
     ```

3. **Impact of RSA Encryption on Message Size**
   - DHushCP uses **RSA-2048** encryption for secure message exchange.
   - For RSA-2048 with **OAEP padding**, the maximum plaintext size per RSA block is **245 bytes**.
   - After encryption, each RSA block expands to **256 bytes**.

   - **Number of complete RSA blocks** that fit within the available DHCP space:
     ```
     Total DHCP Space: 1004 bytes
     RSA Block Size: 256 bytes
     Number of RSA blocks: 1004 bytes √∑ 256 bytes = 3 blocks
     ```

4. **Calculating the Maximum Plaintext Message Size**
   - Each RSA block can hold a maximum of **245 bytes** of plaintext.
   - For **3 RSA blocks**, the maximum plaintext message size is:
     ```
     245 bytes/block √ó 3 blocks = 735 bytes
     ```

### üìä **Summary of Message Length Calculations**
- **Usable Space per DHCP Option**: 251 bytes
- **Total Usable Space Across 4 Options**: 1004 bytes
- **Maximum Encrypted Message Size**: 1004 bytes
- **Maximum Plaintext Message Size**: **735 bytes**

### üö¶ **Recommended Input Limit and Format**
To avoid message truncation and ensure messages fit within the available space, it is recommended to:

1. **Limit the input message to 500 characters**. This limit ensures that:
   - If special characters (e.g., non-ASCII or multi-byte characters) are used, the message still fits within the 735-byte limit.
   
2. **Enter the entire message on a single line**:
   - Users should **avoid pressing the Enter key** until the entire message is typed out.
   - If the Enter key is accidentally pressed before completing the message, the program will prompt the user to continue the message on the same line.

3. **Real-Time Byte Check**:
   - The real-time byte size of the input should be checked before encryption to confirm it does not exceed the available space.

### üîê **Practical Considerations**
- The above calculations assume that the message fits into **three RSA blocks**.
- If the message is larger, the number of fragments and corresponding overhead increase, reducing the effective message size.
- If additional DHCP option fields are used, the message size can be increased accordingly.

## üïµÔ∏è **Example Use Case for DHushCP**

### **Scenario: Covert Communication in a Public Space**

Imagine a scenario where two individuals (Alice and Bob) need to communicate covertly while being in a public space, such as a coffee shop. They both arrive separately and sit at different tables, appearing to be independent customers. They do not connect to the public Wi-Fi network, but their laptops are within wireless range of each other.

### **Problem**
Alice and Bob need to exchange a short message without creating any obvious network link or visible ad-hoc connection that could attract attention. Using traditional messaging apps or establishing a direct Wi-Fi connection could be easily detected by anyone monitoring the network.

### **Solution: Using DHushCP for Covert Communication**

1. **Step 1: Alice Starts the DHushCP Client**
   - Alice runs the DHushCP client on her laptop.
   - Her client sends a `DHCP Discover` packet that contains her public RSA key, embedded and fragmented into multiple DHCP options.
   - This packet is **broadcast** in the local wireless network range.
   
   - üîê **Custom Option 224 Filtering**: Alice‚Äôs client is configured to only accept **DHCP Offer** responses that contain the **custom DHCP option 224**. This ensures that her client ignores any other DHCP servers that might be present in the same area.

2. **Step 2: Bob‚Äôs DHushCP Server Listens and Responds**
   - Bob has the DHushCP server running on his laptop, configured to only respond to DHCP packets that include a special identifier (custom DHCP option `224`) set by DHushCP.
   - The server validates that the packet is from a legitimate DHushCP client and sends back a `DHCP Offer` packet containing his own public RSA key.

3. **Step 3: Key Exchange and Secure Message Transmission**
   - Once Alice receives the `DHCP Offer` from Bob, the two have securely exchanged public keys.
   - Alice then inputs a short covert message (e.g., **"Meet at the corner at 2 PM"**) and her client encrypts the message using Bob‚Äôs public key.
   - The encrypted message is fragmented into multiple DHCP options and sent to Bob in a `DHCP Request` packet.

4. **Step 4: Bob Receives and Decrypts the Message**
   - Bob‚Äôs server receives the `DHCP Request`, reassembles the fragments, and decrypts the message using his private RSA key.
   - The decrypted message is displayed on his terminal.
   - Bob then sends a covert response in the same manner (e.g., **"Understood. See you there."**) using the `DHCP Ack` packet.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **One-Time Message Exchange Design**
- **DHushCP is designed for short-form, one-time message exchanges**. It supports a single message from the client to the server, followed by a response from the server back to the client.
- After each message exchange, the session is terminated, and the RSA keys are securely deleted. If further communication is needed, the process should be restarted from scratch, with **new RSA key pairs** being generated.
- This approach maximizes security by ensuring that each communication session is unique and does not reuse any cryptographic keys.

### **Why This Setup Is Effective**
- The entire exchange happens within **standard DHCP packets**, blending into regular network traffic.
- There is **no visible Wi-Fi connection** or direct link between Alice and Bob.
- After the communication ends, both laptops securely delete the exchanged RSA keys and clear the terminal, leaving no traces behind.
- This approach is useful in scenarios where Alice and Bob want to avoid suspicion and keep their presence discreet while exchanging critical information.

This use case highlights how DHushCP can be employed for **covert communication** using a common network management protocol, making it an effective tool for scenarios where traditional methods are easily detectable.
