## üîç Overview

**DHushCP** is a Linux tool designed to facilitate **secure covert wireless communication** between two parties - an Initiator and a Responder - using standard **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** packets. 

**DHushCP** utilizes principles of **network steganography** by embedding encrypted messages within DHCP protocol fields that are not commonly inspected, such as Options 224, 225, 226. 

By inserting cryptographic elements within unused DHCP options, **DHushCP** enables hidden message exchanges outside existing network infrastructures without raising suspicion.

üçÄ **NOTE:** This is an ongoing **reasearch project** for educational purposes rather than a full-fledged production-ready tool, so treat it accordingly.

### üí¨ TLDR; DHushCP and Steganography
**Steganography** refers to hiding secrets in plain sight, and **DHushCP** does this two-fold:

- **It hides an encrypted message sent from A to B in an unused DHCP option field.**
  - **DHushCP** doesn't require the two hosts to route their communication through a specific network, access point or centralized app. By using plain DHCP Discover packets, the communication blends into normal traffic. Although the messages are **fully encrypted** back and forth between the two hosts, it is advisable to keep a **low number** of message exchanges per session, so that the amount of Discover packets being sent by the hosts doesn't raise any eyebrows. See the **Use Case** below for an example.
- **It uses only DHCP Discover packets to communicate the keys and messages.**
  - At first, the use of **DHCP Discover** packets might seem strange, due to the broadcast nature of these packets. However, this obfuscates the **DHushCP** communication even more compared to even the first iteration of **DHushCP** where the two hosts were actually performing a complete *Discover - Offer - Request - Ack* sequence that was hiding the message exchange. By using DHCP Discover packets only, **DHushCP** is now stealthier since no rogue DHCP server activity can be detected by a sniffer.

## üöÄ Features

- **End-to-End Encryption:** Utilizes Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for secure message exchange between **Initiator** and **Responder**.
- **Message Embedding:** Efficiently embeds keys and messages to fit within DHCP option constraints, ensuring seamless transmission.
- **Checksum Verification:** Implements SHA-256 checksums to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
- **Session Management:** Generates unique session IDs to maintain communication integrity and prevent message mixing.
- **Automated Cleanup:** Automatically handles session termination and cleans up sensitive data upon completion.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive prompts guide users through message input and confirmation steps.

## üîÑ Communication Flow

1. **Initial Exchange:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Generates a unique session ID.
     - Detects and selects the active wireless interface.
     - Generates an ECC key pair (private/public keys).
     - Embeds its public key, the DHUSHCP_ID (option 224), and session ID (option 225) into the DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet and waits for the Responder's public key.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Listens for DHCP Discover packets with option 224 set to DHUSHCP_ID.
     - Upon receiving a valid DHCP Discover (option 224 set to DHUSHCP_ID), extracts the session ID from option 225.
     - Extracts and reassembles the Initiator's public ECC key from the correct DHCP option.
     - Generates its own ECC key pair.
     - Embeds its public key, the DHUSHCP_ID, and the extracted session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover and waits for Initiator's message.

2. **Message Transmission:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Receives the Responder's public key from the DHCP Discover packet.
     - Derives the shared AES key using its private ECC key and the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Prompts the user to input a message to send to the Responder.
     - Encrypts the message using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted message with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted message.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet from the Initiator.
     - Extracts and decrypts the message using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted message to the Responder user.
     - Prompts the Responder user to input a reply message.
     - Encrypts the reply using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted reply with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted reply.

3. **Finalization:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet containing the Responder's reply.
     - Decrypts the reply using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted reply message to the Initiator user.
     - Upon request (`Ctrl+C`), performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs (syslog, auth), and resetting the terminal.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Upon request (`Ctrl+C`), performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs (syslog, auth), and resetting the terminal.

## üïµÔ∏è **Example Use Case for DHushCP**

#### **Scenario: Covert Communication in a Public Space**

Imagine a scenario where two individuals (Alice and Bob) need to communicate covertly while being in a public space, such as a coffee shop. 

They both arrive separately and sit at different tables, appearing to be independent customers. They do not connect to the public Wi-Fi network, but their laptops are within wireless range of each other.

#### **Problem**
Alice and Bob need to exchange a crucial message without using any messaging app, or creating any obvious network link or visible ad-hoc connection that could attract attention and be easily detected by anyone monitoring the network.

üî¥ **Prerequisites:**
- Prior to their arrival, Alice and Bob **should already know** the DHUSHCP_ID they're going to use *and* who's going to run the **Initiator** and the **Responder**, respectively.
- They ensure that the DHUSHCP_ID is communicated **securely** between them before initiating the communication. Use a strong, unpredictable identifier (e.g. `n1c3_w3ath3r_eh?`).

#### **Solution: Using DHushCP for Covert Communication**

1. **Step 1: Bob Starts the DHushCP Responder**
   - Bob runs the **DHushCP** Responder script on his laptop, listening for a Discover packet from Alice.
   - His Responder listens for DHCP Discover packets that contain the identifier (DHUSHCP_ID, option 224) set with **--id DHUSHCP_ID**.
   - This ensures that his Responder only responds to legitimate **DHushCP** Initiator packets and ignores other DHCP traffic.

2. **Step 2: Alice Starts the DHushCP Initiator**
   - Alice runs the **DHushCP** Initiator on her laptop, with the same value for **--id DHUSHCP_ID**.
   - Her Initiator sends a DHCP Discover packet that contains her public ECC key, along with the DHUSHCP_ID (option 224) and a unique session ID (option 225).
   - This packet is **broadcast** in the local wireless network range.

3. **Step 3: Key Exchange and Secure Communication**
   - **Responder**:
     - Receives Alice's DHCP Discover packet.
     - Extracts the session ID and reassembles Alice's public ECC key.
     - Generates its own ECC key pair.
     - Embeds its public ECC key, the DHUSHCP_ID, and the extracted session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet.
   
   - **Initiator**:
     - Receives the Responder's DHCP Discover packet.
     - Extracts and reassembles the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Derives the shared AES key using her private ECC key and the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Prompts the user to input a message (e.g., "Meet at the corner at 2 PM").
     - Encrypts the message using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted message with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted message to the Responder.

4. **Step 4: Receiving and Responding to Messages**
   - **Responder**:
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet from Alice.
     - Decrypts the message using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted message to Bob.
     - Prompts Bob to input a reply (e.g., "Understood. See you there.").
     - Encrypts the reply using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted reply with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted reply back to Alice.
     - Upon request, performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs, and resetting the terminal.
   
   - **Initiator**:
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet containing Bob's reply.
     - Decrypts the reply using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted reply message to Alice.
     - Upon request, performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs, and resetting the terminal.

#### **Why This Setup Is Effective**
- The entire exchange happens within **standard DHCP Discover packets**, blending into regular network traffic.
- There is no centralized app or devices, **no visible Wi-Fi connection** or direct link between Alice and Bob.
- After the communication ends, both laptops securely delete the ECC keys, system logs and clear the terminal.
- Useful when Alice and Bob want to avoid suspicion and keep their presence discreet while exchanging critical information.

#### **Additional Recommendation**
- Prior to running the Initiator or the Responder, disable shell history using `set +o history`, then enable it when the communication is ended using `set -o history`.

### üßÆ **Available Message Space Calculation**

- **Total Usable Space In DHCP Option:** 255 bytes
- **AES-GCM Encryption Overhead (Nonce):** 12 bytes
- **AES-GCM Encryption Overhead (AuthTag):** 16 bytes
- **SHA-256 Checksum Size:** 32 bytes
- **Available Message Space:** 255 bytes - 60 bytes = **195 bytes**

**NOTE!** The current limit for messages is **100 characters**.
