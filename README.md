- **Session Management:** Generates unique session IDs to maintain communication integrity and prevent message mixing.
- **Message Fragmentation:** Efficiently fragments messages to fit within DHCP option constraints, ensuring seamless transmission.
- **Automated Cleanup:** Automatically handles session termination and cleans up sensitive data upon completion.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive prompts guide users through message input and confirmation steps.
- **Checksum Verification:** Implements SHA-256 checksums to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

## üìà Advantages

- **Stealthy Communication:** Leverages the common DHCP protocol to facilitate hidden message exchanges, reducing the likelihood of detection.
- **No Additional Infrastructure:** Operates outside existing network setups without the need for specialized hardware or software.
- **Flexible Integration:** Easily integrates into various network environments, making it adaptable for different use cases.
- **User Control:** Empowers users with interactive prompts, ensuring that communication is deliberate and controlled.
- **Robust Security:** Combines multiple security mechanisms to safeguard data against interception and unauthorized access.

## üîÑ Communication Flow

1. **Initial Exchange:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Generates a unique session ID.
     - Detects and selects the active wireless interface.
     - Generates an ECC key pair (private/public keys).
     - Generates RSA key pair (public/private keys).
     - Embeds its public key, DHushCP-ID (option 224), and session ID (option 225) into the DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet and waits for the Responder's public key.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Listens for DHCP Discover packets with option 224 set to DHushCP-ID.
     - Upon receiving a valid DHCP Discover (option 224 set to DHushCP-ID), extracts the session ID from option 225.
     - Extracts and reassembles the Initiator's public ECC key from the correct DHCP option.
     - Generates its own ECC key pair.
     - Embeds its public key, DHushCP-ID, and the extracted session ID into a DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet back to the Initiator.

2. **Message Transmission:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Receives the Responder's public key from the DHCP Discover packet.
     - Derives the shared AES key using its private ECC key and the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Prompts the user to input a message.
     - Encrypts the message using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted message with the checksum and session ID into a DHCP Discover packet.
     - Fragments and embeds the encrypted message with the checksum and session ID into the DHCP Request packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted message.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet from the Initiator.
     - Reassembles and decrypts the message using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted message to the Responder user.
     - Prompts the Responder user to input a reply.
     - Encrypts the reply using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted reply with the checksum and session ID into a DHCP Discover packet.
     - Generates a checksum for the encrypted reply.
     - Fragments and embeds the encrypted reply with the checksum and session ID into the DHCP Ack packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted reply.

3. **Finalization:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet containing the Responder's reply.
     - Decrypts the reply using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted reply message to the Initiator user.
     - Upon request, performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs, and resetting the terminal.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Receives the DHCP Discover sent by the Initiator.
     - Upon request, performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs, and resetting the terminal.

## üïµÔ∏è **Example Use Case for DHushCP**

#### **Scenario: Covert Communication in a Public Space**

Imagine a scenario where two individuals (Alice and Bob) need to communicate covertly while being in a public space, such as a coffee shop. They both arrive separately and sit at different tables, appearing to be independent customers. They do not connect to the public Wi-Fi network, but their laptops are within wireless range of each other.

#### **Problem**
Alice and Bob need to exchange a short message without creating any obvious network link or visible ad-hoc connection that could attract attention. Using traditional messaging apps or establishing a direct Wi-Fi connection could be easily detected by anyone monitoring the network.

#### **Solution: Using DHushCP for Covert Communication**

1. **Step 1: Bob Starts the DHushCP Responder**
   - Bob runs the **DHushCP** Responder script on his laptop, listening for a Discover packet from Alice.
   - His Responder listens for DHCP Discover packets that contain a special identifier (DHushCP-ID, option 224) set by **DHushCP**.
   - This ensures that his Responder only responds to legitimate DHushCP Initiator packets and ignores other DHCP traffic.

2. **Step 2: Alice Starts the DHushCP Initiator**
   - Alice runs the **DHushCP** Initiator on her laptop.
   - Her Initiator sends a DHCP Discover packet that contains her public ECC key, along with the DHushCP-ID (option 224) and a unique session ID (option 225).
   - This packet is **broadcast** in the local wireless network range.

3. **Step 3: Key Exchange and Secure Communication**
   - Responder:
     - Receives Alice's DHCP Discover packet.
     - Extracts the session ID and reassembles Alice's public ECC key.
     - Generates its own ECC key pair.
     - Fragments and embeds its public ECC key, DHushCP-ID, and the extracted session ID into a DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet.
   
   - Initiator:
     - Receives the Responder's DHCP Discover packet.
     - Extracts and reassembles the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Derives the shared AES key using her private ECC key and the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Prompts the user to input a message (e.g., "Meet at the corner at 2 PM").
     - Encrypts the message using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Fragments and embeds the encrypted message with the checksum and session ID into a DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted message to the Responder.

4. **Step 4: Receiving and Responding to Messages**
   - Responder:
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet from Alice.
     - Reassembles and decrypts the message using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted message to Bob.
     - Prompts Bob to input a reply (e.g., "Understood. See you there.").
     - Encrypts the reply using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Fragments and embeds the encrypted reply with the checksum and session ID into a DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted reply back to Alice.
   
   - Initiator:
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet containing Bob's reply.
     - Reassembles and decrypts the reply using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted reply message to Alice.
     - Performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs, and resetting the terminal.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **One-Time Message Exchange Design**
- **DHushCP is designed for short-form, one-time message exchanges**.
- After each message exchange, the session is terminated, and the ECC keys are securely deleted. If further communication is needed, the process should be restarted from scratch, with **new ECC key pairs** being generated.
- This approach maximizes security by ensuring that each communication session is unique and does not reuse any cryptographic keys.

#### **Why This Setup Is Effective**
- The entire exchange happens within **standard DHCP Discover packets**, blending into regular network traffic.
- There is **no visible Wi-Fi connection** or direct link between Alice and Bob.
- After the communication ends, both laptops securely delete the exchanged RSA keys and clear the terminal, leaving no traces behind.
- This approach is useful in scenarios where Alice and Bob want to avoid suspicion and keep their presence discreet while exchanging critical information.

### üßÆ **Available Message Space Calculation**

- **Total Usable Space Across 4 DHCP Options:** 1,004 bytes
- **RSA Encryption Overhead (4 blocks):** 1,024 bytes
- **Plaintext Capacity (4 blocks √ó 190 bytes):** 760 bytes
- **Checksum Size:** 32 bytes
- **Available Message Space:** 760 bytes - 32 bytes = **728 bytes**

As a result, the current limit for messages is **500 characters**.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora)
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies:**
  - `scapy` for packet crafting and sniffing
  - `cryptography` for RSA encryption and checksum generation
- **Privileges:** Root or sudo access to send and receive DHCP packets
