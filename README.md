# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **DHushCP: Covert Communication Using DHCP**

## üìù **Summary**
**DHushCP** is a covert communication tool that uses the DHCP protocol to enable secure and hidden message exchange between two machines. By embedding encrypted messages into DHCP option fields, DHushCP establishes a secure communication channel that blends seamlessly into regular network traffic, making it extremely difficult to detect. This tool is ideal for scenarios where privacy and stealth are paramount, such as discreet communications in public places or controlled environments.

With features like RSA public-key encryption, message fragmentation, custom DHCP options for server validation, and automatic cleanup, DHushCP ensures that communication is not only secure but also leaves no traces behind once the session is completed.

## üîí **Why Use DHushCP?**
In environments where privacy and security are crucial, traditional messaging applications and network connections can leave traces or be detected easily. **DHushCP** provides a unique solution by using a widely accepted network management protocol (DHCP) for message exchange. It turns a standard protocol into a covert communication channel without creating persistent connections or visible network links, making it an ideal tool for:

- **Stealth Communication in Public Spaces:** Communicate discreetly without establishing visible connections.
- **Red Team Operations:** Test the robustness of network monitoring tools and identify detection gaps.
- **Privacy and Security Research:** Explore covert communication methods in secure environments.

### üîë **Key Security and Privacy Features**
1. **Ephemeral Network Traffic:**
   - DHushCP leverages broadcast-based DHCP packets to exchange messages, leaving no visible network connections and blending into normal network noise.

2. **Stealthy Communication Using Standard Protocols:**
   - By using DHCP, which is essential for network operation, DHushCP avoids detection by intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls that are configured to monitor more active communication protocols.

3. **RSA Public-Key Encryption:**
   - DHushCP exchanges RSA public keys during the initial handshake and encrypts messages using the recipient‚Äôs public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the content.

4. **Fragmented Message Embedding:**
   - Encrypted messages are split into smaller fragments and embedded across multiple DHCP option fields (`43`, `60`, `77`, and `125`), making it difficult to reconstruct the entire message.

5. **Custom DHCP Option for Server Validation:**
   - To prevent interference from other DHCP servers in the vicinity, DHushCP uses a **custom DHCP option** (`224`) that serves as a unique identifier. This ensures that the client only accepts offers from the intended DHushCP server and ignores any other DHCP Offers that might be present.

6. **Automatic Secure Cleanup:**
   - After communication ends, DHushCP deletes the RSA keys from memory, clears the terminal screen, and exits, leaving no traces on the devices.

## üîß **How DHushCP Works**
### üóÇÔ∏è **Step-by-Step Communication Process**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Public Key Exchange**
- **Client:**
  - Generates a fresh RSA public-private key pair.
  - Sends a `DHCP Discover` packet containing its public key, split across multiple DHCP options, along with a **custom DHCP option** (`224`) to uniquely identify the DHushCP session.

- **Server:**
  - Receives the `DHCP Discover` packet, validates the **custom DHCP option** (`224`), and reassembles the client‚Äôs public key.
  - Generates its own RSA key pair.
  - Sends a `DHCP Offer` packet containing its own public key, split across DHCP options, and includes the **custom DHCP option** (`224`).

- **Client:**
  - Receives and reassembles the server‚Äôs public key from the fragmented options in the `DHCP Offer` packet.
  - Validates the **custom DHCP option** to ensure that the `DHCP Offer` is from the intended DHushCP server.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Message Input and Encryption**
- **Client:**
  - Prompts the user for a message to send to the server.
  - Encrypts the message using the **server‚Äôs public key**.
  - Validates the encrypted message size to ensure it can fit into the available DHCP options.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fragmented Message Transmission**
- **Client:**
  - Splits the encrypted message into smaller fragments and embeds them into the DHCP options.
  - Sends a `DHCP Request` packet containing these message fragments.

- **Server:**
  - Receives and reassembles the encrypted message from the DHCP options.
  - Decrypts the message using its **private key**.
  - Prompts the user for a response message to send back.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Message Reception and Decryption**
- **Server:**
  - Splits its encrypted response into fragments and sends them in a `DHCP Ack` packet.

- **Client:**
  - Receives and reassembles the response.
  - Decrypts the message using its **private key** and displays it.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Secure Cleanup**
- **Client:**
  - Sends a `DHCP Release` packet to formally indicate the end of the communication.
  - Deletes its own RSA private key and the server‚Äôs public key from memory.
  - Clears the terminal screen and prints a confirmation dot (`.`).

- **Server:**
  - Receives the `DHCP Release` packet from the client.
  - Deletes its own RSA private key and the client‚Äôs public key from memory.
  - Clears the terminal screen and prints a confirmation dot (`.`).

## üí° **Features**
1. **Stealth Communication Using DHCP:**
   - Embeds encrypted messages into DHCP option fields, blending into regular network traffic.

2. **Asymmetric Encryption:**
   - Uses RSA public-key encryption to protect messages, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message.

3. **Message Fragmentation Across DHCP Options:**
   - Splits messages into multiple fragments across DHCP options, making detection and reconstruction difficult.

4. **Custom DHCP Option Filtering:**
   - Uses a custom DHCP option (`224`) to validate that the client and server are communicating exclusively with each other.

5. **Dynamic Message Input:**
   - Both the client and server receive user input messages during the communication, providing flexibility in the exchanged content.

6. **Automatic Trace Removal:**
   - Cleans up all keys and data, clears the screen, and exits, ensuring no residual data is left behind.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Recommended System Requirements**
- **Operating System**: Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Kali Linux)
- **Python Version**: 3.6 or higher
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `scapy`: For crafting and sending custom DHCP packets.
  - `cryptography`: For RSA encryption and decryption.
  - `os` and `sys`: For system-level commands and secure cleanup.

- **Network Interface**: Wireless interface (e.g., `wlan0`) that supports raw packet injection and sniffing.
- **Memory**: 512MB or higher.
- **Disk Space**: Minimal, less than 10MB for required dependencies.

## üì¶ **Installation and Setup**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/DHushCP.git
   cd DHushCP

   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   pip install cryptography
   pip install scapy
   ```

3. **Run the Server and Client:**
- Start the server on one machine:
   ```bash
   sudo python server.py
   ```
- Start the client on the other machine:
   ```bash
   sudo python client.py
   ```

4. **Message Exchange and Cleanup:**
- The client and server will exchange messages. Once both parties have read the messages, the tool will automatically clean up and exit.

## üîê **Security Considerations**
- **Message Size Limitations**: Messages must be concise due to the limitations of DHCP option fields. If a message is too large, it won‚Äôt fit within the available options.
- **Monitor Mode for Wireless Interfaces**: Ensure that the wireless interfaces used support monitor mode and raw packet manipulation.
- **Controlled Environments**: Always test DHushCP in controlled environments to avoid unintended detection.
